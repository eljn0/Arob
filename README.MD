Official Alzheimer's treatment robot skills,and effects on
Alzheimer people treatment
1. Lowering stress: stress control is important on alzheimer treatment. Patient's
uncontrolable stress may going to make treatment hard, also long. Thats why our
robot is powered by speakers for music depends on patient's music taste. With
microphone feature patient can listen music that he/she likes. Also from the
developer tools it is manual controllable to change music, playlist, podcast. This
function allows to have easy nerved patient. Easy nerved patient means easy to
feed meals, medicines, also satisfied to taking a small shower.
2. Social Interaction and an Active Mind: social interaction is important for
defeating dementia. Our robot's health ruitine is 70% remedy for get rid of this.
Everyday starts with telling information about patient's personal details and family.
After this we have daily news and classic italian music.(it can be change for patients
music taste). Then small exercises for anti-obesity and breakfast. Everyday
repeating this ruitine keeps mind's of alzheimers active. Every good start of the day
we can speed up the process of progression.
3. Healthy Sleep:Sleep is our body’s way of resetting. Proper restful sleep
allows our body and brain the time needed to restore balance to our systems.
This helps reduce dementia and Alzheimer’s. Our treatment robot's solve for
this problem is controllable room supplys. Alzheimer treatment robot also
provided with amazon Iot api, which helpful for controlling smart home
devices. At the end of the day, room of patient's lights are going to turned off
sleeping music playlists are going to play in the room for having a good sleep
for patient. Controllable room makes some more adventages for treatment
too. We can evertime watch smart camera via our alzheimer robot. If its there
problem about patient, nurse can immediately interfence
